Decision-making in science and engineering is mainly informed through model-based predictions, where we first understand and define the questions we are posing and then define models to answer them. However, predictions without <code>uncertainty quantification</code> do not provide the trust needed to inform decisions. On the other hand, when neither the questions nor the underlying models are known, <code>machine learning</code> can be utilized to develop data-driven models.  Similarly, the predictions of the machine learning cannot be used for decision-making without UQ.

In a nutshell, <code>uncertainty quantification (UQ)</code> involves the mathematical treatment of uncertainties in numerical models. More specifically, UQ identifies the sources of uncertainty and quantifies its impact on the behavior of the model in order to:

* Enable robust <code>predictions</code> (<u>forward UQ</u>).
* <code>Infer</code> uncertainties in the model from data (<u>inverse UQ</u>)
* Calculate <code>probability of failure</code> (<u>reliability analysis</u>)
* <code>Prioritize</code> the sources of uncertainty (<u>sensitivity analysis</u>)

My research is contoured around <code>methodological</code> research for <code>uncertainty quantification</code> and <code>machine learning</code>.  Specific projects include: 

* <code>Manifold learning</code> for low-dimensional representation of uncertainties
* <code>Machine learning</code>  for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks
* <code>Uncertainty quantification</code> in <code>machine learning</code>  models
* <code>Active learning</code> for stochastic sampling
* <code>Reliability analysis</code> in the presence of small or incomplete data
* <code>Sensitivity</code> and <code>reliability analysis</code> on the manifold


I am also interested in <code>Scientific software design and development.</code> I am the <code>Lead Developer</code> of the general-purpose, open-source <code>Python</code> package <a href='https://github.com/SURGroup/UQpy' target='_blank'><code>UQpy</code></a> that contains a wide variety of methods for inverse and forward propagation of uncertainty, surrogate modeling, reliability and sensitivity analysis.
