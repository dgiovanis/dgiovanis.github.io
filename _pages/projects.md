## Funded projects

<h3><code>Machine Learning Metallic Glass Structure-Property Relations (2020-present)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.sandia.gov" target="_blank">Sandia National Laboratories</a><br>
<strong>Role</strong>: Co-PI<br>
<strong>Amount</strong>: $200,000<br>

In this project we use <code>machine learning</code> to build a robust bridge between <code>atomic-scale</code> data and the development of <code>meso-scale</code> models suitable for predicting the response of metallic glasses. Specific tasks include: 

* Manifold learning for nonlinear <code>dimension reduction</code> of the atomistic data to identify machine learned descriptors of the material <code>microstructure</code>.
* <code>Deep learning</code> to derive meso-scale constitutive models that predict the evolution of the microstructure and the development of <code>plastic flow</code> resulting in failure.

<h3><code>Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure: Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (2021-2025)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a><br>
<strong>Role</strong>: Co-PI<br>
<strong>Amount</strong>: $100,000<br>


The goal of the <a href="https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org" target="_blank">SimCenter</a> is to promote advanced modeling and simulation technologies for <code>natural hazards</code> engineering researchers and practitioners to understand and quantify the effects of <code>earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis</code>, and other natural hazards on buildings, lifelines, and communities. The objective of this project is to:

* integrate state-of-the-art <code>uncertainty quantification</code> methods with <code>SimCenter tools</code> for hazard modelers.

<h3><code>Manifold Learning for Rapid Post Wildfire Debris Flow Hazard Assessment (2022-2026)</code></h3>

 <strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> (Pending)<br>
  <strong>Role</strong>: Co-PI<br>
 <strong>Amount</strong>: $433,000<br>

<code>Wild fires</code> significantly increase the susceptibility of steep terrain to rainfall-induced debris flows. These fast moving, dense flows are initiated during short, <code>intense rainfall</code> and are often triggered with little-to-no warning, making them especially dangerous for communities situated down slope of recently burned terrain. Uncertainties in <code>soil properties,rainfall</code>,and <code>triggering mechanisms</code> play a crucial role in risk analysis. We develop a:

* <code>mechanics-based</code> and <code>data-driven</code> approach for assessing <code>post-wildfire debris flow hazard</code> both in terms of triggering and areal extent.

<h3><code>Data-driven uncertainty quantification for energetic materials (2022-2023)</code></h3>


 <strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://hemi.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute</a> (Pending)<br>
  <strong>Role</strong>: PI<br>
 <strong>Amount</strong>: $25,000<br>

Energetic materials such as <code>propellants, explosives</code>, and <code>pyrotechnics</code> are key performance components in a wide range of defense applications, including solid rocket motors and munitions. Sensitivity of energetic materials to loading (e.g., shock) is critically dependent on the <code>heterogeneities of the microstructure</code>. Given its inherently stochastic nature, in order to understand, predict and control the shock-to-detonation or shock-to-deflagration transition, it is crucial to conduct uncertainty quantification. In this project, we develop:

* <code>manifold learning-based surrogate models</code> that will accelerate UQ.

## Engagement in other on-going projects

<h3><code>Low-dimensional manifold learning for uncertainty quantification in complex multi-scale stochastic sytems (2019-2024)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.energy.gov" target="_blank">Department of Energy</a><br>

This work is primarily focused on the mathematical development of <code>dimension reduction methods</code> for uncertainty quantification. Within a multiscale setting, active learning methods are employed at each length-scale to develop <code>physically-informed</code> surrogate models that can be used for <code>prediction</code> at each length-scale and across length scales. The surrogates at each scale are trained to be predictive while maintaining the physical interpretation of the solution.

<h3><code>OptiSimCVD: a data-driven framework for prediction, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactors (2021-2024)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.ceratizit" target="_blank">CERATIZIT</a>, <a href="https://www.fnr.lu" target="_blank">Luxembourgh National Research Fund</a><br>

The project OptiSimCVD proposes a data-driven framework for prediction, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification in <code>industrial-scale processes</code> used to produce hard coatings and wear protection. The core of the production process is <code>Chemical Vapor Deposition</code> (CVD) reactors with different set up but with a common goal: uniform coatings with strict limits of variability.

<h3><code>MSEE: A University Research Alliance for Materials Science in Extreme Environments (2020-2029)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.dtra.mil" target="_blank">Defence Threat Reduction Agency</a><br>

An alliance of 18 research institutions led by the Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with the <code>Defense Threat Reduction Agency</code> (DTRA) to advance fundamental science to reduce the threat of <code>weapons of mass destruction</code>. My role is to lead UQ efforts across the consortium with Prof. Mike Shields.

<h3><code>Data-driven Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Human Head Models (2020-2022)</code></h3>

<strong>Funding Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov" target="_blank">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a><br>

Computational models of the <code>human head</code> are promising tools for estimating the impact-induced response of brain, and thus play an important role in the prediction of <code>traumatic brain injury</code>. Modern biofidelic head model simulations are associated with very high computational cost, and high-dimensional inputs and outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods on these systems.
