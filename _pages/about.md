I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the  <strong>Department of Civil and Systems Engineering</strong> (<a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">CaSE</a>) at the <strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong> (JHU), a program  that stands for:

### <i>Civilization Engineered</i>

I am also a fellow at the Hopkins <strong>Extreme Materials Institute</strong> (<a href="https://hemi.jhu.edu">HEMI</a>) and a member of the <strong>Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science</strong> (<a href="https://idies.jhu.edu">IDIES</a>). 


## Research Highlights

* I perform computational research.
* My research is on <code>uncertainty quantification</code> in computational models using <code>Machine Learning</code>.
* But.. I am also interested in quantifying uncertainties in <code>Machine Learning</code>.
* Lately, I have been working on <code>Manifold learning</code>.
* My research is <code>multidisciplinary</code>. It lies at the intersection of <code>applied mathematics, data science, physics-based modeling</code> and <code>engineering</code>.
* I work on problems from <code>materials science, natural hazard engineering</code> and <code>biomechanics</code>.


## Non-Research Highlights

*  I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team.
* I play the classic guitar.
* I love (good!) coffee.
* I have two cats.
