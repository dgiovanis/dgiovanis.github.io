I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Systems Engineering (CaSE)</a> at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a one of a kind program that aims to broaden the perspective beyond traditional Civil engineering (<i>Civilization Engineered</i>) in order to address the intertwined engineering and sociotechnical systems lying at the core of society's grand challenges. I am also a fellow at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hopkins+HEMI&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute</a> (HEMI). 

Prior to that I was a postdoctoral scholar working with Prof. <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/michael-shields/" target="_blank">Michael Shields</a>  in CaSE at JHU. I have a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering in the area of <i>Stochastic Finite Element Methods and Reliability analysis</i> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=gNdMW-sAAAAJ&hl=el" target="_blank">V. Papadopoulos</a>  and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wwTD1HcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">M. Papadrakakis</a> from the National Technical University of Athens. I hold an M.Sc. in <a href="http://compmech.chemeng.ntua.gr/?&lang=en" target="_blank">Computational Mechanics </a>  of solids and a 5-year diploma in <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/schools/item/25-school-of-civil-engineering" target="_blank">Civil (Structural) Engineering</a>. 


With regards to my non-academic and research interests, I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team. I also play the classic guitar, and I love (good!) coffee, my two cats, travelling, swimming and my motorcycle!
