I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Systems Engineering</a>  (CaSE) at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a one of a kind program that aims to broaden the perspective beyond traditional Civil engineering (<i>Civilization Engineered</i>) in order to address the intertwined engineering and sociotechnical systems lying at the core of society's grand challenges. I am also a fellow at the <a href="https://hemi.jhu.edu">Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute</a> (HEMI). 

My research is focused on the development of computational methods for <strong>uncertainty quantification</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> with applications in materials science, natural hazard engineering and biomechanics. My research is strongly multidisciplinary in nature and lies in the intersection of applied mathematics, data science, physics-based modeling and engineering. Some applications of interest are:

* Influence of microstructural randomness, imperfections, and uncertainties on the properties of structural materials that enables the design, optimization, and utilization of new materials, such as metallic glasses and energetic materials for advanced applications and under extreme conditions.<br>
* Integrating uncertainty quantification and machine learning methods with natural hazard engineering modeling for understanding and quantifying the effects of earthquakes, hurricanes, storm surge, and other natural hazards on buildings, lifelines, and communities.<br>
* Influence of uncertainty in the geometry, boundary conditions and material properties of biofidelic head models on the impact-induced response of the human brain to increase the reliability in the prediction of traumatic brain injury.


With regards to my non-academic and research interests, I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team. I also play the classic guitar, and I love (good!) coffee, my two cats, travelling, swimming and my motorcycle!
