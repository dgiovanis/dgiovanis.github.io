## Welcome!

Uncertainty plays an outsized role in our understanding of structures and materials, especially in extreme environments, but it can also have a life changing impact -- for example, natural hazards can affect a community, a city, and can often impact an entire country. Therefore, reducing uncertainty in the modeling of physical or structural systems is critical if we want to inform decision-making and enable engineering to move away from empirical <i>ad hoc</i> approaches into strategies that are based on scientifically grounded analyses.


In this context, uncertainty quantification (UQ) identifies the sources of uncertainty and quantifies their impact on the response of the model in order to enable robust predictions, perform reliability assessments (probability of failure) and sensitivity analyses (prioritization of sources of uncertainty). Even though much of the low-hanging fruit in UQ - such as simplified models that have low-dimensional uncertainties with known probability distributions - has been bagged, the vast majority of UQ methods are not applicable to real-world problems. Challenges that arise include:

* Parameter distributions must be inferred from small or noisy data
* Parameterized uncertainties may be extremely high dimensional
* Repeated evaluation of expensive computational models that may require days to execute

My research addresses these challenges by advancing foundational computational methodologies for <strong>uncertainty quantification</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> for a broad range of materials and engineering applications.  Specific projects include: 

* Manifold learning for latent representation of uncertainties
* Machine learning for surrogate modeling 
* Bayesian inference for inverse problems
* Structural reliability
* Active learning methods 
* Scientific software design and development

I am also the <strong>Lead Developer</strong> of the general-purpose, open-source <code>Python</code> package <a href='https://github.com/SURGroup/UQpy' target='_blank'><code>UQpy</code></a> that contains a wide variety of methods for inverse and forward propagation of uncertainty, surrogate modeling, reliability and sensitivity analysis. 


### About me 

I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Systems Engineering (CaSE)</a> at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a one of a kind program that aims to broaden the perspective beyond traditional Civil engineering (<i>Civilization Engineered</i>) in order to address the intertwined engineering and sociotechnical systems lying at the core of society's grand challenges. I am also a fellow at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hopkins+HEMI&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute</a> (HEMI). 

Prior to that I was a postdoctoral scholar working with Assoc. Prof. <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/michael-shields/" target="_blank">Michael Shields</a>  in CaSE at JHU. Prior to joining JHU, I completed my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering in the area of Stochastic Finite Element Methods and Reliability analysis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=gNdMW-sAAAAJ&hl=el" target="_blank">V. Papadopoulos</a>  and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wwTD1HcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">M. Papadrakakis</a> at the National Technical University of Athens. I hold an M.Sc. in <a href="http://compmech.chemeng.ntua.gr/?&lang=en" target="_blank">Computational Mechanics of Solids </a> and a 5-year diploma in <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/schools/item/25-school-of-civil-engineering" target="_blank">Civil (Structural) Engineering</a>. 


With regards to my non-academic and research interests, I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team. I also play the classic guitar, and I love (good!) coffee and basketball.
