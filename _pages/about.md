I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the  <strong>Department of Civil and Systems Engineering</strong> (<a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">CaSE</a>) at the <strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong> (JHU), a program that aims to broaden the perspective beyond traditional Civil engineering in order to address the intertwined engineering and sociotechnical systems lying at the core of society's grand challenges (<i>Civilization Engineered</i>). I am also a fellow at the Hopkins <strong>Extreme Materials Institute</strong> (<a href="https://hemi.jhu.edu">HEMI</a>) and a member of the <strong>Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science</strong> (<a href="https://idies.jhu.edu">IDIES</a>). 


## Research Highlights

* I perform computational research.
* I am interested in quantifying and propagating <code>uncertainties</code> in computational models using <code>Machine Learning</code>.
* But.. I am also interested in quantifying uncertainties in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.
* Lately I have been also working on <strong>Manifold learning</strong>.
* My research is <strong>multidisciplinary</strong>. It combines applied mathematics, data science, physics-based modeling and engineering.
* I work on problems from <strong>materials science, natural hazard engineering</strong> and <strong>biomechanics</strong>.


## Non-Research Highlights

*  I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team.
* I play the classic guitar.
* I love (good!) coffee.
* I have two cats.
* I am a fanatic swimmer.
* ...and a proud owner of a Yamaha FZ6 naked.
