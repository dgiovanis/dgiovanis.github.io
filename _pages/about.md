I am an <strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong> in the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Systems Engineering</a>  (CaSE) at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a one of a kind program that aims to broaden the perspective beyond traditional Civil engineering (<i>Civilization Engineered</i>) in order to address the intertwined engineering and sociotechnical systems lying at the core of society's grand challenges. I am also a fellow at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hopkins+HEMI&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute</a> (HEMI). 

My research is focused on the development of computational methods for uncertainty quantification and machine learning for a wide range of applications. My research is strongly multidisciplinary in nature and lies in the intersection of applied mathematics, data science, physics-based modeling and engineering. Some applications of interest are:

* Influence of microstructural randomness, imperfections, and uncertainties on the properties of structural materials that enables the design, optimization, and utilization of new materials, such as metallic glasses and energetic materials for advanced applications and under extreme conditions.<br>
* Assessing post-wildfire debris flow hazard both in terms of triggering and areal extent by incorporating the spatial and temporal variability and uncertainty in soil material properties and triggering characteristics.<br>
* Uncertainty quantification in computational models of the human head for estimating the impact-induced response of the brain and increase the reliability of model predictions for traumatic brain injury.

With regards to my non-academic and research interests, I am an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the JHU men's <a href="https://hopkinssports.com/sports/mens-water-polo" target="_blank">Water Polo</a> varsity team. I also play the classic guitar, and I love (good!) coffee, my two cats, travelling, swimming and my motorcycle!
