<h5>Johns Hopkins University</h5> 
<ol>
  <li><strong>Applied Math for Engineers</strong> (EN.560.601) -- <strong>Level</strong>: Graduate, <strong>Format</strong>: Lecture</li>
  This course presents a broad survey of the basic mathematical methods used
in the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations: linear algebra, power series,
Fourier series, separation of variables and integral transforms.

  <li><strong>Case Coding</strong> (EN.560.291) -- <strong>Level</strong>: Undergraduate, <strong>Format</strong>: Lecture</li>
  Having taken a computing course in the freshman year, this course allows students to further develop their programming skills to solve, understand, or automate problems specific to Civil and Systems Engineering. Students learn fundamental engineering and data analytics operations skills in a variety of softwares (e.g., R, Matlab, ArcGIS).

  <li><strong>Gateway Computing Python</strong> (EN.500.113) -- <strong>Level</strong>: Undergraduate, <strong>Format</strong>: Flipped Classroom</li>
  This course introduces fundamental programming concepts and techniques
using Python programming language. Topics covered include the design and implementation
of algorithms using variables, control structures, arrays, functions, files, testing, debugging,
and structured program design. Elements of object-oriented programming, algorithmic
efficiency and data visualization are also discussed.

<h3>**Teaching Assistant**</h3> 

<h5>National Technical University of Athens</h5> 
<ol>
  <li><strong>Stochastic Finite Elements</strong> -- <strong>Level</strong>: Graduate, <strong>Format</strong>: Lecture<br>
  This course introduces  the fundamentals of the stochastic process theory and its applications. Topics covered include widely used  methods for the simulation of stochastic processes, namely the  Karhunen-Loeve expansion and spectral representation method. Moreover, the fundamental principles of the Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM) were discussed and the topic of reliability analysis methods was addressed.
