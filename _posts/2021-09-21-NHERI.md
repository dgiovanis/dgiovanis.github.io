 I have joined the  National Science Foundationâ€™s <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/news/case-researchers-establish-practices-for-uncertainty-quantification-in-hazards-modeling-through-renewal-of-national-science-foundations-simcenter/" target="_blank">SimCenter</a> team in order to use my expertise in uncertainty quantification (UQ) and machine learning to aid in software development tasks related to UQ/ML in SimCenter software tools that will help to understand and quantify the effects of earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural hazards on buildings, lifelines, and communities.
