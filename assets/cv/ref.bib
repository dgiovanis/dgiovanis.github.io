abstract = {This paper presents the UQpy software toolbox, an open-source Python package for general uncertainty quantification (UQ) in mathematical and physical systems. The software serves as both a user-ready toolbox that includes many of the latest methods for UQ in computational modeling and a convenient development environment for Python programmers advancing the field of UQ. The paper presents an introduction to the software's architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy. This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in sampling and forward propagation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure. This example is used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in variance reduction sampling techniques, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling and active learning techniques.}

    abstract = {It is common knowledge that the analysis of structural systems with am- biguous characteristics has been the focal point of research work over the course of the last two decades. Epistemic uncertainty can be taken into consideration in simulation by setting the problem in a probabilistic frame- work, resulting to governing equations that are, in general, stochastic par- tial differential equations. Throughout this period of time, a plethora of stochastic finite element methodologies (SFEM) for the numerical solu- tion of the stochastic partial differential equations involved in such prob- lems have been developed. It could be argued that one of the most blurry areas in these methodologies is the computational effort involved. This thesis presents a series of methodologies that have been implemented in the framework of SFEM and reliability analysis in order to reduce the computational effort involved.},

    abstract = {The objective of this work is to quantify the uncertainty in probability of failure estimates resulting from incomplete knowledge of the probability distributions for the input random variables. We propose a framework that couples the widely used Subset simulation (SuS) with Bayesian/information theoretic multi-model inference. The process starts with data used to infer probability distributions for the model inputs. Often such data sets are small. Multi-model inference is used to assess uncertainty associated with the model-form and parameters of these random variables in the form of model probabilities and the associated  joint parameter probability densities. A sampling procedure is used to construct a set of equally probable candidate probability distributions and an optimal importance sampling distribution is determined analytically from this set. Subset simulation is then performed using this optimal sampling density and the resulting conditional probabilities are re-weighted using importance sampling. The result of this process are empirical probability distributions of failure probabilities that provide direct estimates of the uncertainty in failure probability estimates that result from inference on small data sets. The method is demonstrated to be both computationally efficient -requiring only a single subset simulation and nominal cost of sample re-weighting- and to provide reasonable estimates of the uncertainty in failure probabilities.}

    abstract = {In this paper, a novel surrogate model based on the Grassmannian diffusion maps (GDMaps) and utilizing geometric harmonics is developed for predicting the response of engineering systems and complex physical phenomena. The method utilizes the GDMaps to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the underlying behavior of physical/mathematical systems with respect to uncertainties in the input parameters. Using this representation, geometric harmonics, an out-of-sample function extension technique, is employed to create a global map from the space of input parameters to a Grassmannian diffusion manifold. Geometric harmonics is also employed to locally map points on the diffusion manifold onto the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. The exponential map is then used to project the points in the tangent space onto the Grassmann manifold, where reconstruction of the full solution is performed. The performance of the proposed surrogate modeling is verified with three examples. The first problem is a toy example used to illustrate the development of the technique. In the second example, errors associated with the various mappings employed in the technique are assessed by studying response predictions of the electric potential of a dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous electric field. The last example applies the method for uncertainty prediction in the strain field evolution in a model amorphous material using the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory of plasticity. In all examples, accurate predictions are obtained, showing that the present technique is a strong candidate for the application of uncertainty quantification in large-scale models.}

    abstract = {In this work we introduce a manifold learning-based method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data representing quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model. For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the significant acceleration of UQ tasks.}

    abstract = {Constructing surrogate models for uncertainty quantification (UQ) on complex partial differential equations (PDEs) having inherently high-dimensional O(10≥2) stochastic inputs (e.g., forcing terms, boundary conditions, initial conditions) poses tremendous challenges. The “curse of dimensionality” can be addressed with suitable unsupervised learning techniques used as a pre-processing tool to encode inputs onto lower-dimensional subspaces while retaining its structural information and meaningful properties. In this work, we review and investigate thirteen dimension reduction methods including linear and nonlinear, spectral, blind source separation, convex and non-convex methods and utilize the resulting embeddings to construct a mapping to quantities of interest via polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). We refer to the general proposed approach as manifold PCE (m-PCE), where manifold corresponds to the latent space resulting from any of the studied dimension reduction methods. To investigate the capabilities and limitations of these methods we conduct numerical tests for three physics-based systems (treated as black-boxes) having high-dimensional stochastic inputs of varying complexity modeled as both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields to investigate the effect of the intrinsic dimensionality of input data. We demonstrate both the advantages and limitations of the unsupervised learning methods and we conclude that a suitable m-PCE model provides a cost-effective approach compared to alternative algorithms proposed in the literature, including recently proposed expensive deep neural network-based surrogates and can be readily applied for high-dimensional UQ in stochastic PDEs}

    abstract = {Computational models of the human head are promising tools for estimating the impact-induced response of the brain, and thus play an important role in the prediction of traumatic brain injury. The basic constituents of these models (i.e., model geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions) are often associated with significant uncertainty and variability. As a result, uncertainty quantification (UQ), which involves quantification of the effect of this uncertainty and variability on the simulated response, becomes critical to ensure reliability of model predictions. Modern biofidelic head model simulations are associated with very high computational cost and high-dimensional inputs and outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional UQ methods on these systems. In this study, a two-stage, data-driven manifold learning-based framework is proposed for UQ of computational head models. This framework is demonstrated on a 2D subject-specific head model, where the goal is to quantify uncertainty in the simulated strain fields (i.e., output), given variability in the material properties of different brain substructures (i.e., input). In the first stage, a data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density estimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input random vector directly from the available data. Computational simulations of a small number of realizations provide input-output pairs for training data- driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ nonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps, Gaussian process regression to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector and the reduced solution space, and geometric harmonics models for mapping between the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It is demonstrated that the surrogate models provide highly accurate approximations of the computational model while significantly reducing the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations of the surrogate models are used for uncertainty propagation. UQ of the strain fields highlights significant spatial variation in model uncertainty, and reveals key differences in uncertainty among commonly used strain-based brain injury predictor variables.}

    abstract = {This work introduces the Grassmannian diffusion maps (GDMaps), a novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that defines the affinity between points through their representation as low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to points on the Grassmann manifold. The method is designed for applications, such as image recognition and data-based classification of constrained high-dimensional data where each data point itself is a high-dimensional object (i.e., a large matrix) that can be compactly represented in a lower-dimensional subspace. The GDMaps is composed of two stages. The first is a pointwise linear dimensionality reduction wherein each high-dimensional object is mapped onto the Grassmann manifold representing the low-dimensional subspace on which it resides. The second stage is a multipoint nonlinear kernel-based dimension reduction using diffusion maps to identify the subspace structure of the points on the Grassmann manifold. To this end, an appropriate Grassmannian kernel is used to construct the transition matrix of a random walk on a graph connecting points on the Grassmann manifold. Spectral analysis of the transition matrix yields low-dimensional Grassmannian diffusion coordinates embedding the data into a low-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Further, a novel data classification/recognition technique is developed based on the construction of an overcomplete dictionary of reduced dimension whose atoms are given by the Grassmannian diffusion coordinates. Three examples are considered. First, a “toy” example shows that the GDMaps can identify an 
    appropriate parametrization of structured points on the unit sphere. The second example demonstrates the ability of the GDMaps to revealing the intrinsic subspace structure of high-dimensional random field data. In the last example, a face recognition problem is solved considering face images subject to varying illumination conditions, changes in face expressions, and occurrence of occlusions. The technique presented high recognition rates (i.e., 95% in the best case) using a fraction of the data required by conventional methods.},

The method exploits subspace-structured features of each solution by projecting it onto a Grassmann manifold. This point-wise linear dimensionality reduction harnesses the structural information to assess the similarity between solutions at different points in the input parameter space. The method utilizes a solution clustering approach in order to 
    identify regions of the parameter space over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be interpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order solutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold using the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the Karcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are projected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean using the exponential mapping. For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression model is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced solution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space. Using this Gaussian process model, the full-field solution can be efficiently predicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the solution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such cases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based spatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the Euclidean space. 
    The proposed method is applied to two numerical examples. The first is a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation with uncertain initial conditions where the surrogate is used to predict the time history solution. The second involves modeling of plastic deformation in a model amorphous solid using the Shear Transformation Zone theory of plasticity, where the proposed surrogate is used to predict the full strain field of a material specimen under large shear strains.},

    simulation to be performed directly with non-Gaussian, highly dependent, or implicitly defined random variables

In this work a Neural Network-based SS (SS-NN) methodology is proposed in which NN are effectively trained over smaller sub-domains of the total random variable space which are generated progressively at each SS level by the modified Metropolis algorithm. NN are then used as robust meta-models in order to increase the efficiency of SS by increasing significantly the samples per SS level with a minimum additional computational effort. In the numerical examples considered, it is demonstrated that the training of a sufficiently accurate NN meta-model in the context of SS simulation leads to more robust estimations of the probability of failure both in terms of mean and variance of the estimator.},

This way the influence of the response variance to the spectral content (correlation structure) of the random input is taken into account through a spatial variation of the truncated KL terms. The criterion for selecting the number of KL terms at different parts of the structure is the uniformity of the spatial distribution of the second-order error. This way a significantly reduced number of PC coefficients, with respect to classical PC expansion, is required in order to reach a uniformly distributed target second-order error.
